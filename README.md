Yahoo Finance Forex Trend Analysis (EUR/JPY) - 2003 to 2023
Overview
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of the historical trends in the exchange rates of the Euro (EUR) and Japanese Yen (JPY) from 2003 to 2023 using data obtained from Yahoo Finance. In addition to traditional statistical analysis, this project incorporates machine learning algorithms to provide predictive insights into future trends.

Data Source
The historical forex data used in this analysis was retrieved from Yahoo Finance, a reputable source for financial market data. The dataset comprises daily exchange rate records for the EUR/JPY currency pair, covering a period of two decades, from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2023.

Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the historical exchange rate data and develop predictive models to forecast future trends in the EUR/JPY currency pair. The project encompasses the following phases:

Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Exploratory data analysis to understand the historical trends and patterns.
Utilization of machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future exchange rate movements.
Evaluation of model performance and assessment of predictive accuracy.
Data Exploration
Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and format date columns correctly. Duplicate records, if any, were removed.
Statistical Summary: Descriptive statistics were computed to understand key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation for the exchange rate.
Time Series Decomposition: A time series decomposition was performed to identify underlying trends, seasonality, and noise.
Machine Learning Models
Time Series Forecasting: Utilization of machine learning models such as ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet to predict future exchange rate movements.
Feature Engineering: Creation of relevant features from historical data to improve model performance.
Model Training and Validation: Models were trained on historical data and validated using appropriate techniques like cross-validation.
Results and Predictions
Model Predictions: The project will present predictions for the EUR/JPY exchange rate for a future period, based on the trained machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and visualizations will be provided to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.
Conclusions
Based on the analysis of historical data and machine learning predictions, the project will draw conclusions regarding:

Historical trends in the EUR/JPY exchange rate.
Accuracy and reliability of machine learning predictions.
Implications for investors, traders, or policymakers.
