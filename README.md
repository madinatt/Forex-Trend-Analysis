## Data Source

The historical forex data used in this analysis was obtained from Yahoo Finance, a trusted source for financial market data. The dataset comprises daily exchange rate records for the EUR/JPY currency pair, covering a period of two decades, from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2023.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical exchange rate data and employ regression machine learning algorithms to create models capable of predicting future trends in the EUR/JPY currency pair. The project encompasses the following phases:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand historical trends, patterns, and factors influencing exchange rates.
- Selection, training, and evaluation of regression models for predicting future exchange rate movements.

## Data Exploration

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and format date columns correctly. Duplicate records, if any, were removed.
- **Statistical Summary**: Descriptive statistics were computed to understand key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation for the exchange rate.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: A time series decomposition was performed to identify underlying trends, seasonality, and noise.

## Regression Models

- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant features from historical data, such as lag variables, moving averages, and economic indicators.
- **Model Selection**: Utilization of regression machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net Regression.
- **Model Training and Validation**: Models were trained on historical data and validated using techniques like cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE).

## Results and Predictions

- **Model Predictions**: The project will present predictions for the EUR/JPY exchange rate for a future period, based on the trained regression machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics and visualizations will be provided to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictive models.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis of historical data and regression machine learning predictions, the project will draw conclusions regarding:

- Historical trends in the EUR/JPY exchange rate.
- The accuracy and effectiveness of different regression models in predicting future exchange rate movements.
- Insights into potential economic and geopolitical factors influencing exchange rates.
